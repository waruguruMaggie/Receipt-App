Assume that an Android Application is required to automate sales in a small shop. The application works
as follows:
1. The price of each item is hard coded in the source code of the program.
2. The quantity of each item bought is determined by the number of buttons clicks for that item.
For example, to buy three loaves of bread, the button for bread must be clicked exactly three
times.
3. The maximum quantity of ANY item that can be bought is 4. For example, the application
cannot sell more than 4 loaves of bread.
4. Discount of 15% only applies when the Grand Total amount exceeds 10,000 otherwise, a
toast message should show that no discount is awarded.
